# Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to my project on predicting housing prices using Linear Regression with the Boston Housing dataset.

This repo is part of my learning journey in machine learning and data analysis, focusing on:

- Building intuition around model fitting
- Interpreting results like R² scores
- Understanding the relationship between socioeconomic factors and real estate prices

## Project Highlights

- A simplified model using only the **LSTAT** (percentage of lower-status population) feature to predict **MEDV** (Median value of owner-occupied homes)
- Clear visualization of the regression line vs actual data
- Calculation and interpretation of the **R² score** to evaluate model performance
- Code structured for clarity and learning, ideal for beginners looking to understand the basics of regression
