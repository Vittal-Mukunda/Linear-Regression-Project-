Welcome to my project on predicting housing prices using Linear Regression with the Boston Housing dataset.

This repo is part of my learning journey in machine learning and data analysis, focusing on building intuition around model fitting, interpreting results like R² scores, and understanding the relationship between socioeconomic factors and real estate prices.

A simplified model using only the LSTAT (percentage of lower-status population) feature to predict MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes).A clear visualization of the regression line vs actual dataCalculation and interpretation of the R² score to evaluate model performance.Code structured for clarity and learning, ideal for beginners looking to understand the basics of regression.
